# Variables

## Printing text to the console

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("I am learning Go...")
}
```

## Declaring a variable

### The sad way üò¢

```go
// initialize variable (it defaults to 0)
var mySkillIssues int

// overwrite the zero value
mySkillIssues = 42
```

### The GOATed way üòé

```go
mySkillIssues := 42
```

The walrus operator `:=` should be used whenever you can. It can't be used, however, outside a function. Moreover, Go infers that `mySkillIssues` is an `int` because of its value `42`. This is called **type inference**.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    messageStart := "Happy birthday! You are now"
    age := 21
    messageEnd := "years old!"

    fmt.Println(messageStart, age, messageEnd)

    // Happy birthday! You are now 21 years old!
}
```

## The Compilation Process

The code that we write in Go is not readable by the machine. Therefore, it needs to go through a compiler in order to convert it into machine language.

code -> compiler -> executable

```go
/* lets the compiler know that we want this code to compile
and run as a standalone program, as opposed to being a library */
package main

/* imports the fmt package from the standard library to allow
us to use the Println method to print to the console */
import "fmt"

/* the main function, entry point for a Go progam */
func main() {
    // code here
}
```

## üèÉüí® Fast and Compiled

Go is one of the fastest programming languages. Faster than interpreted languages like JavaScript and Python, but not as fast as low-level languages like Rust, Zig or C.

However, it _compiles faster_ than all of them, which makes the developer experience super productive.

## Type Sizes

### Whole Numbers

- no decimal
- `int int8 int16 int32 int64`

### Positive whole numbers

- no decimal
- `uint uint8 uint16 uint32 uint64`

### Signed decimal numbers

- `float32 float64`

### Imaginary numbers (rarely used)

- `complex64 complex128`

Unless you have specific needs or concerned about _performance_ and _memory usage_, the "standard" types should be used to avoid confusion and maintain code readability:

- `int`
- `float64`

and "standard" sizes:

- `int`
- `uint`
- `float64`
- `complex128`

## Converting Types

```go
accountAgeFloat := 2.6
accountAgeInt := int(accountAgeFloat)

// this truncates the value of the float.
// accountAgeInt = 2
```

## Go is statically typed

What does it mean? It means that the code will not compile if errors are detected during production. Whereas dynamically typed languages like JavaScript and Python, the program needs to run in order to detect issues.

Once it is compiled, the compiled executable can be run _without_ the source code.

## Small Memory Footprint

Go programs are lightweight.

- Go runtime cleans up unused memory at runtime.
- Garbage collector automatically frees up memory that's no longer in use.
