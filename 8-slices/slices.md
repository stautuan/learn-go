## Array

These are fixed-size groups of the same type, like "ice cubes" -- ice (type) in a tray (array) ðŸ˜…

`[n]T` is an array of n values of type `T`

To declare an array of 10 integers:

```go
var myInts [10]int
```

To declare an initialized literal:

```go
primes := [6]int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}
```

## Slices

Arrays are fixed in size. Once you make an array like `[10]int` you cannot add an 11th element.

The zero value of slice is `nil`.

```go
primes := [6]int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}
mySlice := primes[1:4]
// mySlice = {3, 5, 7}
```

The syntax is `arrayname[lowIndex:highIndex]`, where `lowIndex` is inclusive and `highIndex` is exclusive.

Both can also be omitted `arrayname[:]`. This represents an empty array.

## Make

We can create a new slice using the `make` function!

```go
// func make([]T, len, capacity) []T
mySlice := make([]int, 5, 10)

// the capacity argument is usually omitted and defaults to the length
mySlice := make([]int, 5)
```

When we make slices, it is filled with zero values.

Here is how we can fill it:

```go
mySlice := []string{"I", "love", "go"}

// notice that the square brackets didn't have a 3 in them
// if they did, it would be an array instead of a slice
```

- `len()`: is the current length of the slice
- `cap()`:is the maximum length of the slice
- `len()` and `cap()` return 0 when the slice is `nil`

## Variadic

Variadic functions are functions that can take many arguments of the same type without explicity declaring it. This is useful when you don't know how many arguments you'll need to pass.

You define a variadic function by using `...` before you declare the type.

```go
func concat(strs ...string) string {
    final := ""
    // strs is just a slice of strings
    for i := 0; i < len(strs); i++ {
        final += strs[i]
    }
    return final
}

func main() {
    final := concat("Hello ", "there ", "friend!")
    fmt.Println(final)
    // Output: Hello there friend!
}
```

### Spread operator

Spread operator allows us to pass a slice into a variadic function. It consists of three dots after the slice.

```go
func main() {
    names := []string{"bob", "sue", "alice"}
    printStrings(names...)
}
```

## Append

Append allows us to dynamically add elements to a slice.

```go
func append(slice []Type, elems ...Type) []Type
```
