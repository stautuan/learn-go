/*
Write a function using the `append()` function. It accepts a slice of `cost` structs 
and returns a slice of `float64`s, where `float64` represents the total cost for a day.

The length of the returned slice should be inferred from the highest numbered `day`
field. Some days may have multiple costs, while others may have none. Include all
actual and implied totals in the returned slice, starting with day '0'. Use the 
`append()` function to dynamically increase the size of the returned slice when needed.
