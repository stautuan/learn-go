## Array

These are fixed-size groups of the same type, like "ice cubes" -- ice (type) in a tray (array) ðŸ˜…

`[n]T` is an array of n values of type `T`

To declare an array of 10 integers:

```go
var myInts [10]int
```

To declare an initialized literal:

```go
primes := [6]int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}
```

## Slices

Arrays are fixed in size. Once you make an array like `[10]int` you cannot add an 11th element.

The zero value of slice is `nil`.

```go
primes := [6]int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}
mySlice := primes[1:4]
// mySlice = {3, 5, 7}
```

The syntax is `arrayname[lowIndex:highIndex]`, where `lowIndex` is inclusive and `highIndex` is exclusive. Both can also be omitted `arrayname[:]`.
